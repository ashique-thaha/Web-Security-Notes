The same-origin policy is a key mechanism implemented within browsers that is designed to keep content that came from different origins from interfering with each other. 

Basically, content received from one website is allowed to read and modify other content received from the same site but is not allowed to access content received from other sites.

If the same-origin policy did not exist, and a  victim browsed to a malicious website, script code running on that site could access the data and functionality of any other website also visited by the user. 

This may enable the malicious site to perform funds transfers from the victimâ€™s online bank, read his or her web mail, or capture credit card details when the user shops online. For this reason, browsers implement restrictions to allow this type of interaction only with content that has been received from the same origin.

In practice, applying this concept to the details of different web features and technologies leads to various complications and compromises. Here are some key features of the same-origin policy that you need to be aware of:

 - A page residing on one domain can cause an arbitrary request to be made to another domain (for example, by submitting a form or loading an image). But it cannot itself process the data returned from that request.

 - A page residing on one domain can load a script from another domain and execute this within its own context. This is because scripts are assumed to contain code, rather than data, so cross-domain access should not lead to disclosure of any sensitive information.

 - A page residing on one domain cannot read or modify the cookies or other DOM data belonging to another domain.

These features can lead to various cross-domain attacks, such as inducing user actions and capturing data. Further complications arise with browser extension technologies, which implement same-origin restrictions in different ways.
