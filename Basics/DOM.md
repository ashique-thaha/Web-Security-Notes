The Document Object Model (DOM) is an abstract representation of an HTML document that can be queried and manipulated through its API.

The DOM allows client-side scripts to access individual HTML elements by their id and to traverse the structure of elements programmatically. 

Data such as the current URL and cookies can also be read and updated. The DOM also includes an event model, allowing code to hook events such as form submission, navigation via links, and keystrokes.

Manipulation of the browser DOM is a key technique used in Ajax-based applications.
