we can use whois tool for to look for contact details, emails, address etc. These details are taken from domain registrar to whom the domains provided the details for registering a domain.
some times these domains hide their details by using a service called domain privacy. 

here we do a reverse dns.Â searching a database by using an organisation name, a phone number, or an email address to find
domains registered with it. This way, you can find all the domains that belong to the same owner. Reverse WHOIS is extremely useful for finding obscure or internal domains not otherwise disclosed to the public. Use a public reverse WHOIS tool like ViewDNS.info

```
https://viewdns.info/reversewhois/
```

to conduct this search. WHOIS and reverse WHOIS will give you a good set of top-level domains to work with.
