OSNIT is the practice of gathering intel from public sources of
information.


First, check the company’s job posts for engineering positions.
Engineering job listings often reveal the technologies the company uses.

For example, take a look at an ad like this one:
```
Full Stack Engineer
Minimum Qualifications:
Proficiency in Python and C/C++
Linux experience
Experience with Flask, Django, and Node.js
Experience with Amazon Web Services, especially EC2, ECS, S3, and RDS
```

From reading this, you know the company uses `Flask, Django, and Node.js` to build its web applications. 

The engineers also probably use `Python, C, and C++` on the backend with a Linux machine. 

Finally, they use AWS to outsource their operations and file storage.

If you can’t find relevant job posts, search for employees’ profiles on LinkedIn, and read employees’ personal blogs or their engineering questions on forums like Stack Overflow and Quora.

The expertise of a company’s top employees often reflects the technology used in development

Another source of information is the `employees’ Google calendars`.

People’s work calendars often contain meeting notes, slides, and sometimes even login credentials.If an employee shares their calendars with the public by accident, you could gain access to these. 

The organisation or its employees’ social media pages might also leak valuable information.

For example, hackers have actually discovered sets of valid credentials on Post-it Notes visible in the background of office selfies!

If the company has an engineering mailing list, sign up for it to gain insight into the company’s technology and development process. 

Also check the company’s SlideShare or Pastebin accounts. Sometimes, when organisations present at conferences or have internal meetings, they upload slides to SlideShare for reference. 

You might be able to find information about the technology stack and security challenges faced by the company.


`Pastebin (https://pastebin.com/)` is a website for pasting and storing text online for a short time. People use it to share text across machines or with others. 

Engineers sometimes use it to share source code or server logs with their colleagues for viewing or collaboration, so it could be a great source of information. 

You might also find uploaded credentials and development comments.  You can also use automated tools like `PasteHunter (https://github.com/kevthehermit/PasteHunter/)` to scan for publicly pasted data.

Lastly, consult archive websites like the `Wayback Machine (https://archive.org/web/)`, a digital record of internet content. 

It records a site’s content at various points in time. Using the Wayback Machine, you can find old endpoints, directory listings, forgotten subdomains, URLs, and files that are outdated but still in use.

Tomnomnom ’s tool :`Waybackurls (https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls/)`can automatically extract endpoints and URLs from the Wayback Machine.
