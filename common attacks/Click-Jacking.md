Clickjacking, or user-interface redressing, is an attack that tricks users into clicking a malicious button that has been made to look legitimate. 

Attackers achieve this by using HTML page-overlay techniques to hide one web page within another.

There is an html feature called `iframe` which is in-fact used for to  embed one html page inside another.

Attackers manipulate users by embedding an iframe of a legitimate website and trick users.

for example we attackers  can overlay a button we made to trick users, which will in-fact process the request we attackers gave. 

user will think it is from the site they visited. This button or a form itself might be transferring money to attackers account.
